This program solves the Funding Circle Coding Challenge, which is to print out a multiplication table of the first 10 prime numbers.

It requires Python 3. There is no installation required besides simply cloning this repository. It can be run from the command line by typing `./prime_challenge.py`.

A number of primes for the table can be optionally passed as a parameter. For example, to make a table of only the first 5 prime numbers, run `./prime_challenge.py 5`. If this parameter is omitted, the program will use 10 primes.

The tests can be run by running `./prime_challenge_test.py`.
